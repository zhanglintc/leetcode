-- Problem:
-- X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.
-- Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

-- For example, table cinema:

-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
-- |   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
-- |   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
-- |   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
-- |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- For the example above, the output should be:
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
-- |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
-- |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
-- +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+

-- Write your MySQL query statement below
select * from cinema
where description != "boring" and id % 2 = 1
order by rating desc
