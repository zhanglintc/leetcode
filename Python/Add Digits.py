# Problem:
# Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

# For example:
# Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

# Follow up:
# Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

# Hint:
# 1. A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?
# 2. What are all the possible results?
# 3. How do they occur, periodically or randomly?
