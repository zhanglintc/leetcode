# Problem:
# Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it
# while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

# Note:
# You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
# Minimize the total number of operations.

class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        cnt = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                cnt += 1

        for i in range(cnt):
            nums.remove(0)

        nums += [0 for i in range(cnt)]
