# Problem:
# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

# For example,
# Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.

# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

# Credits:
# Special thanks to @mithmatt for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

class Solution:
    # @param {integer[]} nums
    # @param {integer} k
    # @return {integer}
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        pass
