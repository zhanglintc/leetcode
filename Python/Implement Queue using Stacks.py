# Problem:
# Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

# push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
# pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
# peek() -- Get the front element.
# empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

# Notes:
# You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size,
# and is empty operations are valid.
# Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively.
# You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue),
# as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
# You may assume that all operations are valid
# (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

class Queue:
    # initialize your data structure here.
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # @param x, an integer
    # @return nothing
    def push(self, x):
        pass

    # @return nothing
    def pop(self):
        pass

    # @return an integer
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # @return an boolean
    def empty(self):
        pass
