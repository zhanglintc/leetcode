# Problem:
# Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

# For example:
# Given the following binary tree,
#    1            <---
#  /   \
# 2     3         <---
#  \     \
#   5     4       <---
# You should return [1, 3, 4].

# Definition for a  binary tree node
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # @param root, a tree node
    # @return a list of integers
    def rightSideView(self, root):
        pass
